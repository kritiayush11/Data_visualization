Viva Questions and Answers

	1.	What is a scatter plot?
            A scatter plot is a graphical representation used to 
            show the relationship or correlation between two numerical variables. 
            Each point represents an observation.
            
	2.	How do you identify correlations in a scatter plot?
	•	Positive correlation: Points slope upward (as one variable increases, the other increases).
	•	Negative correlation: Points slope downward (as one variable increases, the other decreases).
	•	No correlation: Points are randomly scattered.
 
	3.	What are some limitations of scatter plots?
	•	They can only display relationships between two variables.
	•	Overlapping points can make it hard to see patterns.
	•	They don’t indicate causation, only correlation.

 	4.	What is PCA and why is it used?
            PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique. 
            It reduces the number of variables while retaining most of the data’s variability,
            making it easier to visualize and analyze high-dimensional data.
            
	5.	Explain eigenvectors and eigenvalues in PCA.
	•	Eigenvectors determine the directions of the principal components.
	•	Eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance captured by each eigenvector.
 
	6.	How does PCA help in dimensionality reduction?
            PCA transforms data into a new set of variables (principal components) ranked by their variance. 
            By keeping only the top components, 
            we reduce the data’s dimensionality while preserving most of its information.

    7.	What does the tasklist command do?
            It lists all currently running processes on a Windows system, 
            including their process IDs and memory usage.
            
	8.	How would you process and visualize tasklist data?
	•	Save the output to a text file using tasklist > file.txt.
	•	Parse the file to extract data on process names and memory usage.
	•	Use visualization tools like bar plots to display memory usage by process.

    9.	List the visual variables and explain each.
	•	Position: The location of an element (e.g., a point on a graph).
	•	Size: The magnitude of a variable represented by the size of elements (e.g., bubble size).
	•	Shape: Different shapes used to distinguish categories.
	•	Color: Encodes information about categories or magnitudes.
	•	Orientation: The angle or direction of elements (e.g., line slopes).
	•	Texture: Patterns used to differentiate regions.
	•	Motion: Animation to depict time-based changes.
	•	Volume: Depth in 3D plots.
 
	10.	How do visual variables improve data comprehension?
            Visual variables make data intuitive by leveraging human perception, 
            making patterns, trends, and outliers easier to identify.
            
	11.	What are limitations of using too many visual variables?
	•	Overloading a chart with variables can make it confusing.
	•	Viewers may struggle to focus on important information.

 	12.	What is a multivariate graph?
            A graph that displays more than two variables simultaneously, 
            such as scatterplot matrices, 3D scatter plots, or heatmaps.
            
	13.	Name some examples of multivariate visualizations.
	•	Scatterplot matrix
	•	3D scatter plot
	•	Heatmap
	•	Parallel coordinates plot
 
	14.	When would you use a 3D plot?
            When there are three numerical variables to visualize, 
            and you want to observe their relationships in a single graph.


    15.	How would you visualize geographical data?
             By plotting data on a map using tools like Folium, Matplotlib, 
             or Plotly, with markers, heatmaps, or choropleth layers.
             
	16.	What tools and libraries can you use for mapping in Python?
	•	Folium: For interactive maps.
	•	Matplotlib/Seaborn: For static maps.
	•	Plotly: For dynamic visualizations.
	•	Geopandas: For geographical data manipulation and visualization.

 	1.	What is a word cloud, and how is it generated?
               A word cloud is a visual representation of text data where the size of each word indicates its frequency.
               It is generated by analyzing the text and counting word occurrences.
               
	2.	What are its advantages and limitations?
              Advantages:
	•	Easy to understand and visually appealing.
	•	Highlights the most frequent words.
              Limitations:
	•	Does not convey context or relationships between words.
	•	Less useful for large datasets with subtle differences.
